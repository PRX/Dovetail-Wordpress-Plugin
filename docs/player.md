# Play Podcast Episode On Your Site

Dovetail Podcasts provides a customizable audio player intended for manual placement within your siteâ€™s templates or content areas. The plugin does not automatically insert the player into posts or pages. This approach gives you complete control over when, where, and how the player appears on your site.

## Player Features

Designed for both designers and developers, the Dovetail Podcasts Player offers a highly customizable and modular architecture that fits seamlessly into any site. With an intuitive structure and straightforward implementation, it enables fast integration while providing the flexibility to tailor the experience to specific design and functionality needs.

### Highly Customizable

Style the player easily using your own CSS. Every component can be individually targeted and customized. It comes with a clean, minimalist default look that works great out of the box or as a starting point for deeper customization.

### Modular Architecture

The player is built with a flexible, component-based structure. You can include only the parts you need. Whether you want a full-featured experience or just a simple play button, it gives you complete control over what gets used.

### Easy to Implement

It is simple to add audio players across your site. Each player component is built as a modern web component and comes with its own block and shortcode. Use the block editor for visual placement, insert shortcodes into posts and pages, or embed components directly in theme template files using raw HTML.
