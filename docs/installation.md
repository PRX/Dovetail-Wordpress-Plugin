# Installation

(COMING SOON) Install via Wordpress admin by going to **Plugins > Add New Plugin** and searching for 'Dovetail Podcasts', or run:

```bash
wp plugin install dovetail-podcasts --activate
```

Installation can also be done manually by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/PRX/Dovetail-Wordpress-Plugin/releases) file and extracting it into `wp-content/plugins`, then run:

```bash
wp plugin activate dovetail-podcasts
```

Once activated, look for the **Dovetail** link in the main admin menu.
