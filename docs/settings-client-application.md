# Connect To Dovetail

To connect the plugin to Dovetail, got to **Dovetail** settings and provide your Client Application key and secret, which can be found by logging into your [Dovetail account](https://id.prx.tech/). Go to the **Client Applications** tab and select which application you want to use. Use the Key and Secret values to connect Wordpress plugin to Dovetail. Once connected, you should be presented with a confirmation, your user information, and a list of podcasts you have access to.

> Do not see the **Client Applications** tab? Contact PRX Support to request an application be setup for you. If your site has a staging or development environment, also request a staging application be created, so your testing doesn't affect your actual podcast episodes and feeds.

## Manage Client Application

In the case where you need to change what Client Application you use to connect to Dovetail, the first thing that needs to be done is to remove the existing connection.

1. Got **Dovetail Settings > Manage Client Application**.
2. Enter "DELETE" then click **Save**.
3. Enter the new Client Application's Key and Secret, then click **Save**.

> Make sure the user of the new Client Application has access to all the podcasts of the previous Client Application user to enure all your podcast episode posts stay connected to their Dovetail data.
